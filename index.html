            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> 
                
                For the purposes of ECE 499 offered by the UVic Electrical and Computer Engineering department, 
                our team of three students have designed a project that identifies a real world problem and provides a solution to it. 
                The project was to be designed and implemented over the course of the Summer 2024 semester. 
                <br><br>
                The problem we decided to tackle was "ghost traps", which are lost or abandoned crab traps left in the ocean.
                Ghost traps continue to catch marine life indiscriminately, 
                causing significant environmental harm and economic losses.
                <br>
                Trap Finder provides a reliable, eco-friendly solution for tracking traps using solar-powered transmitters and a receiver with LoRa technology and GPS.
                <br>
                <br>

            <h2>Why is our product needed?</h2>
            <p>Trap Finder provides a reliable, eco-friendly solution 
                for tracking traps using solar-powered transmitters and a receiver with LoRa technology and GPS</p>
            <p>Using innovative technology for trap management offers numerous benefits. 
                It reduces ghost fishing, thereby protecting marine ecosystems. 
                Additionally, it provides economic savings by enhancing operational efficiency, saving fishers both time and money. 
                The real-time tracking capability ensures that traps can be easily located and retrieved, further streamlining the fishing process.</p>
